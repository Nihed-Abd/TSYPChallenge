        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p>

        <p>Pluto is an icy dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known dwarf planet. Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun.</p>

        <h1>Credits</h1>
        <p>Inspired by this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/9805475-Planets-landing-page" target="_blank">Dribbble Shot</a>. This was built using <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/" target="_blank">fullPage.js</a>. I used <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for content,  <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> for images of planets and <a href="https://codepen.io/prathameshkoshti/pen/oNgVdXV" target="_blank">this codepen</a> for the particles in bg. I also used a bunch of numbers I found online to get somewhat close to scale planets when off in the distance. It is worth noting the distance between the planets isn't even remotley accurate.</p>
